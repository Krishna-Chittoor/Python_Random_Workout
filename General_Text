When there is a index value called out of the range then Python throws "List Index Out of range" error. 
Example:

a = [1,2,3,4] which has the index values 0,1,2 and 3 respectively. In this case, when we print list[4], it gives the above error 


fruits = ["Strawberries", "Nectarines", "Apples", "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears"]
vegetables = ["Spinach", "kale", "Tomatoes", "Celery", "Potatoes"] 

dirty_dozen = [fruits, vegetables]
print(dirty_dozen)
